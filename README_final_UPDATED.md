# ⚾ PitchDNA

PitchDNA is a full-stack machine learning web application that helps players, coaches, and scouts find the most similar MLB pitches — based on spin, velocity, and movement. It combines a user-friendly UI, a fast backend API, UMAP visualizations, and real MLB video footage via Statcast.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Compare by Player Name** – Search for similar pitches by entering pitcher, pitch type, and year
- 🧠 **Compare by Pitch Characteristics** – Input raw pitch metrics to find your closest MLB comps
- 📊 **UMAP Visualization** – 2D map of pitch similarity across the league with dynamic user pitch marker
- 🎥 **Statcast Video Integration** – Click to watch matched pitches via Baseball Savant
- 🧬 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Backend ML model for pitch similarity
- 🤖 **Fuzzy Matching** – Handles imprecise player name inputs
- 💻 **Deployed Full Stack** – React frontend on S3, FastAPI backend on EC2, connected via Axios

```

- **Frontend**: Hosted on AWS S3
- **Backend**: FastAPI app on EC2 managed by PM2 and served using Uvicorn
- **Data**: Statcast + UMAP + fuzzy-matched video links

## 🧱 Why I Didn't Use Docker

For this version of PitchDNA, I opted for a direct EC2 deployment using a virtual machine and process manager (PM2). This choice allowed me to:
- Focus on building and deploying the ML-powered application logic
- Gain hands-on experience configuring persistent services without orchestration
- Keep deployment simple and transparent for portfolio/demo purposes

While containerization with Docker or ECS would improve portability, this project demonstrates a realistic EC2-based production deployment that mirrors many real-world setups.

## 🧠 How It Works

Users can search by:
- **MLB Pitcher + pitch type + year**, or
- **Manual input of pitch characteristics**

Backend:
- Finds matches using KNN
- Projects features into UMAP space
- Builds video links using StatsAPI and fuzzy name resolution
- Returns top 5 comps + UMAP chart

## 📁 Data Overview

Each CSV in `backend/data/` serves a purpose in the transformation pipeline:

- **`pitcher_stats_{year}.csv`**  
  Raw data from Baseball Savant. Contains pitch metrics like spin, speed, movement, and pitcher metadata.

- **`pitcher_stats_combined_2015_2025.csv`**  
  Merged raw data from all years into a single CSV for unified processing.

- **`pitcher_long_format.csv`**  
  Reformats combined data into a "long" format — one row per pitch.

- **`pitcher_long_format_with_umap.csv`**  
  Adds UMAP coordinates for each pitch for similarity visualization.

- **`pitcher_long_format_with_validated_pitchers.csv`**  
  Intermediate output used to check the accuracy of pitch-to-video matching using fuzzy name and ID matching. Identifies mismatches in prior linking.

- **`pitcher_verified_ids_with_gamepk_pitchnum.csv`**  
  Uses pybaseball and Euclidean distance to match each row to a pitch in an MLB game, extracting `gamepk` and `pitch_number`.

- **`final_dataset_pitchDNA.csv`**  
  Final dataset used in production. Created by `Get_working_URLs.py`, this file combines validated pitch data with the correct playId and constructs working Statcast video URLs.

## 🧪 Logging

Logging is implemented via Python's `logging` module. The backend logs key events:
- Incoming API requests
- Similarity matches and scores
- Fuzzy name resolution
- Video link generation success/failure

This helps track performance and debug production issues.
