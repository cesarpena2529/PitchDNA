# âš¾ PitchDNA

PitchDNA is a full-stack machine learning web application that helps players, coaches, and scouts find the most similar MLB pitches â€” based on spin, velocity, and movement. It combines a user-friendly UI, a fast backend API, UMAP visualizations, and real MLB video footage via Statcast.

## Scalable Prototype and Modeling Approach

This project demonstrates a scalable implementation of a machine learning approach to pitch similarity using a custom distance-based retrieval system. The complete datasetâ€”spanning over a decade of MLB pitch-level data from Baseball Savant (2015â€“2025)â€”is fully ingested and processed by the backend service. This shows the systemâ€™s capability to handle the full volume of real-world data without subsetting or downsampling.

For dimensionality reduction and visualization, the project uses UMAP (from the umap-learn library) and PCA (via scikit-learn) to map high-dimensional pitch features into interpretable 2D space, as shown in the [Pitch_Similarity_UMAP_Demo.ipynb](./Pitch_Similarity_UMAP_Demo.ipynb) notebook. This Jupyter notebook clearly documents the modeling steps and walks through the full process of loading raw features, transforming them, and calculating similarity via Euclidean distance.

While no deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were required for this task, the choice of traditional ML techniques was intentional. The problem spaceâ€”a real-time search and retrieval engineâ€”benefits more from speed and interpretability than complex modeling. Libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `scipy` were selected for their scalability, transparency, and alignment with the projectâ€™s real-time inference goals.

The GitHub repository includes clear, modular backend code (`main.py`), a production-ready deployment using EC2 and PM2, and step-by-step notebooks for UMAP visualization and similarity matching. This architecture ensures the application is both practical and extensibleâ€”ready for further optimization or integration with more advanced ML components if needed.

##  Why I Didn't Use Docker

For this version of PitchDNA, I opted for a direct EC2 deployment using a virtual machine and process manager (PM2). This choice allowed me to:
- Focus on building and deploying the ML-powered application logic
- Gain hands-on experience configuring persistent services without orchestration
- Keep deployment simple and transparent for portfolio/demo purposes

While containerization with Docker or ECS would improve portability, this project demonstrates a realistic EC2-based production deployment that mirrors many real-world setups.

##  How It Works

Users can search by:
- **MLB Pitcher + pitch type + year**, or
- **Manual input of pitch characteristics**

Backend:
- Finds matches using KNN
- Projects features into UMAP space
- Builds video links using StatsAPI and fuzzy name resolution
- Returns top 5 comps + UMAP chart

##  Data Overview

Each CSV in `backend/data/` serves a purpose in the transformation pipeline:

- **`pitcher_stats_{year}.csv`**  
  Raw data from Baseball Savant. Contains pitch metrics like spin, speed, movement, and pitcher metadata.

- **`pitcher_stats_combined_2015_2025.csv`**  
  Merged raw data from all years into a single CSV for unified processing.

- **`pitcher_long_format.csv`**  
  Reformats combined data into a "long" format â€” one row per pitch.

- **`pitcher_long_format_with_umap.csv`**  
  Adds UMAP coordinates for each pitch for similarity visualization.

- **`pitcher_long_format_with_validated_pitchers.csv`**  
  Intermediate output used to check the accuracy of pitch-to-video matching using fuzzy name and ID matching. Identifies mismatches in prior linking.

- **`pitcher_verified_ids_with_gamepk_pitchnum.csv`**  
  Uses pybaseball and Euclidean distance to match each row to a pitch in an MLB game, extracting `gamepk` and `pitch_number`.

- **`final_dataset_pitchDNA.csv`**  
  Final dataset used in production. Created by `Get_working_URLs.py`, this file combines validated pitch data with the correct playId and constructs working Statcast video URLs.

##  Logging

Logging is implemented via Python's `logging` module. The backend logs key events:
- Incoming API requests
- Similarity matches and scores
- Fuzzy name resolution
- Video link generation success/failure

This helps track performance and debug production issues.
